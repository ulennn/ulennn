# 👋 Hi, my name is Adam and this is my GitHub profile ✨ 

### 🛠️ I'm currently working on notespace.pl - a free educational platform for all students from Poland.
We created it as part of a nationwide competition of social projects called "Zwolnieni z Teorii". During the final, we won the Silver Wolf (for the best project in a given province) and reached the quarter-finals of the Pitch Contest - this means that we presented our project in front of an audience of several thousand.

### ❓ What experience do I have?
I worked for 2.5 years on Unity and C# <br>
I know the basics of HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and MySQL <br>
I'm learning flutter now, planning to release my own mobile app soon 🙌 <br>
