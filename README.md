# 👋 Hi, my name is Adam and this is my GitHub profile ✨ 

### 🛠️ I'm currently working on notespace.pl - a free educational platform for all students from Poland.
We created it as part of the Olympiad of social projects called "Zwolnieni z Teorii". We are waiting for its final on April 21, but as we have already obtained the quarter-final of the Pitch Contest and a nomination for the Golden Wolf (the best possible award). We also confess the Silver Wolf, which is the best project in a given province.

### ❓ What experience do I have?
I worked for 2.5 years on Unity and C#
I know the basics of HTML, CSS, JS, PHP and MySQL
I'm learning flutter now, planning to release my own mobile app soon 🙌
